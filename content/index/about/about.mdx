Glad you asked. I'm Anshay, a passionate developer and entrepreneur, and student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I love tackling creative challenges and creating products that have a tangible impact and improve lives of others.

Since I wrote my first line of code in an after-school class during elementary school, I've been fascinated by the power programming grants us to create change.

I have experience with developing and releasing mobile apps on the iOS and Android platforms. I've also developed several full-stack web applications, extending my skillset to API development, full-stack web app development, and back-end development. I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to explore new fields and push my boundaries.
